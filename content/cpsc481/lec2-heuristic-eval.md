Heuristic evaluation is a usability engineering method for finding the usability problems in a UI design so that they can be attended to as part of an iterative design process. Heuristic evaluation involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics"). Heuristic evaluation is performed by having each individual evaluator inspect the interface alone. Only after all evaluations have been completed, the evaluators allowed to communicate and have their findings aggregated. The procedure is important in order to ensure independent and unbiased evaluations from each evaluator.

Duting the evaluation process, the evaluator goes through the interface several times and inspects the various dialogue elements and compares them with a list of recognized usability principles, heuristics. The evaluators decide on their own how they want to proceed with evaluating the interface. A general recomendation would be that they go through the interface at least twice. The first pass would be intended to get a feel for the flow of the interaction and the general scope of the system. The second pass then allows the evaluator to focus on specific interface elements while knowing how they fit into the larger whole.

The result of heuristic evaluation is a list of **usability problems** in the interface with references to those usability principles that were violated by the design. It's not sufficient enough for evaluators to simply say that they do not like something; they should explain **why** they do not like it with reference to the heuristics.

## Heuristics

A heuristic is a rule of thumb - a principle that is a shortcut for solving a problem or making decisions.

### 1. Visibility of system status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

### 2. Match between system and the real world

The system should speak users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

### 3. User control and freedom

Users often choose system function by mistake and will need a clearly marked "exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.

### 4. Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

### 5. Error prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occuring in the first place.

### 6. Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the user's memoryload by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogs should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

### 9. Help users recognize, dianose, and recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

### 10. Help and documentation

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

### Severity Rating

Used to allocate resources to fix problems. It is a combination of:

- Frequency
- Impact
- Persistence (one time or repeating)

Severity rating should be estimated after all problems have been seen.
