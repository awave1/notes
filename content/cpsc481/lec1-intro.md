## About

## Characteristics of a good interface

- People feel **satisfied** when they use them
- People can complete their tasks error-free
- People can complete their tasks quickly
- People can learn how to use the system (and its full functionality) quickly

## What is Design?

**Design** is a process of creating of shaping tools or arifacts for direct human use. Design is human centric

### Design vs. Engineering

**Engineering**:

- Make a mostly known outcome possible
- Construct a bridge based on specifications

**Design**:

- Envision new possibilities, new outcomes
- Determine what outcome should result among infinite possibilities
- Reliance on process over formulae
- Humans are central actors "in the loop"
- Context (cultural and temporal) matters


### Design vs. Art

**Design**:

- (as we regard it) concerns the creation of something **useful** and **usable**
  - Useful:
  - Usable:

## Why should we care?

There's shift of attention in computer science: Algorithms $\to$ People

## What is 'designed'?

Anything consciously intended for human use is designed.

## Why is design hard?

A lot of different end-users and everyone is different. It is impossible to satisfy everyone. People appropriate technology unexpectedly.

Judging/predicting which design will be successful is hard. There are infinite possibilities what is good. Design involves making trade-offs. Good designs are non-obvious: we need to try out and experiment.

### People make errors: two kinds of them

- **Slips**: Error in carrying out an action (e.g motor action) 
- **Mistake**

Good designers help people avoid mistakes.

## Core design skills

To synthesize a solution from all of the relevant constraints, understanding everything that will make a difference to the result.

To frame or reframe, the problem and objective.

To create and envision alternatives.
