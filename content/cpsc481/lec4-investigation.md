The goal of investigation phase is to understand the state of the world, state of our users and what the problem is.

Can we simply rely on *what people say*?

- Not completely, people are really good at framing their needs within the language of their current designs

Often, people can't see past their immediate problems to the possibilities. And people have bad memory, e.g. won't be able to remember all the details. Therefore people are really good at telling us a few things:

- What they are **doing** right now
- How they are **feeling** right now
- What their **goal** is right now

It would be beneficial to combine interview with observation:

- watch people in their own environment
- watch people do everyday tasks

Opportunities for new designs arise from:

- workarounds
- breakdowns
- unexpected uses of existing tools

Using a combination of what they are good at telling up, and observing them tells us a lot. Mismatches between what they say and what they do often leads to new designs as well. Your assumptions are likely to be wrong. To discover more, assume that your assumptions are **always wrong**.
