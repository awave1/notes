## LOOK

LOOK at what people really do.

### Rapid Etnography

**How**: Spend as much time as possible with people relevant to the design topic. Establish trust in order to participate in their natural habitat.

**Why**: This is a good way to achieve deep understanding of habits, rituals, meanings around relevant activities and artifacts.

### Fly on the wall

**How**: Observe and record behavior within its context without interfering with people's activities.

**Why**: It is useful to see what people actually do within real contexts and time frames rather than rely on what they said they do.

### Timelapse

**How**: Set up a timelapse camera to record movements in a space over an extended period of time.

**Why**: Useful for providing an objective, longitudinal view of activity within a context.

### Behavioral Archaelogy

**How**: Look for evidence of people's activities inherent in the placement, wear patterns, and organization of things.

**Why**: This reveals how artifacts and environments figure in people's lives highlighting aspects of their lifestyle, habits, priorities and values.

**Key things to pay attention to**:

- space
- actors
- activities
- objects
- workarounds
- acts
- events/triggers
- time
- goals
- feelings

## ASK

ASK is used when looking is not enough. LOOKing gives you great insight into the state of the world. But it doesn't tell you **why** people are acting the way they do or what their goals, needs, or feelings are.

ASK users for help.

### Surveys & Questionnaires

**How**: Ask a series of targeted questions in order to ascertain particular characteristics and perceptions of users.

**Why**: A quick way to get answers from large number of people.

### Narration

**How**: Ask participants to describe the task they are executing.

**Why**: Useful to reach users' motivations, concerns, perceptions, and reasoning

### Foreign correspondents

**How**: Request input from coworkers from other countries and conduct a cross-cultural study to derive basic international design principles.

**Why**: Good way to illustrate the varied cultural and environmental contexts in which products are used.

### Camera journal

**How**: Ask users to keep a written and visual diary of their impressions, circumstances, and activities related to the product.

**Why**: Useful for prompting users to reveal points of view and patterns of behavior.

### Collage

**How**: Ask participants to build a collage from a provided collection of images and explain the significance of the images and arrangements they choose

**Why**: It illustrates participants' understanding and perceptions of issues and helps them visualize complex or unimagined themes.

### Draw the experience

**How**: Ask participants to visualize an experience through drawings and diagrams.

**Why**: Can be a good way to debunk assumptions and reveal how people conceive of and order their experiences or activities.

### Card sort

**How**: List possible features on cards and ask people to organize them in a way that makes sense to them.

**Why**: This helps to expose people's mental models of a system. Their organization reveals expectations and priorities about the intended functions.

## LEARN

After collecting data from LOOKing and ASKing, it's time to LEARN from that data.

### Flow analysis

**How**: Represent the flow of information or activity through all phases of a system or process.

**Why**: Useful for identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for functional alternatives.

### Error analysis

**How**: List the things that can go wrong when using a product and determine the various possible causes.

**Why**: Good way of understanding how design features mitigate or contribute to inevitable human errors and other failures.

### Cognitive task analysis

**How**: List and summarize all of user's sensory inputs, decision points and actions.

**Why**: Good for understanding users' perceptual, attentional, and informational needs and to identify bottlenecks where errors may occur.

### Character profiles

**How**: Based on observations of real people, develop character profiles to represent archetypes and the details of their behavior or lifestyle.

**Why**: This is a useful way to bring a typical customer to life and to communicate the value to different concepts t various target groups.

A persona: constructions that represent different kinds of users. These are based off user research, and represent general classes of people.

A *proto-persona*: a meta version of a persona.

### Anthropometric analysis

**How**: Use human population measurement data to check the coverage and suitability of the design solution for the target user group.

**Why**: This helps to identify a representative group of people for testing design concepts and evaluating the general usability of product details.

### Secondary research

**How**: Review published articles, papers, and other documents to develop an informed point of view on the design issues.

**Why**: Useful way to ground observations and to develop a point of view on the state of the art.

### Affinity diagrams

**How**: Cluster design elements according to intuitive relationships such as similarity, dependence, proximity, etc.

**Why**: Useful way to identify connections between issues and reveal innovation opportunities.

## TRY

### Empathy tools

**How**: Use tools to test whether the design is suitable for people with disability issues.

**Why**: A way to understand people with special conditions.

### Role playing

**How**: Identify stakeholders involved in the design problem and assign those roles to members of your team.

**Why**: Can raise relevant issues and trigger empathy for actual users.

### Be your customer

**How**: Ask the client to describe, outline their typical customer experience.

**Why**: Helpful way to reveal the client's perception of their customer and provide an informative contrast to actual customer experiences.

### Paper prototyping

**How**: Rapidly sketch, layout, and evaluate interaction design concepts for basic usability.

**Why**: Good way to quickly organize and visualize interaction design concepts.

### Quick and dirty prototyping

**How**: Using any available materials, quickly assemble a prototype for evaluation.

**Why**: Good way to communicate a concept to the team and evaluate how to refine the concept.

### Try it yourself

**How**: Use the product or prototype you are designing.

**Why**: Trying the product being designed prompts the team to appreciate the experience the actual users might have.

## Summary

- Apply TRY techniques once you start getting ideas to test them early for their feasibility.
  - Can lead to more robust prototypes later

### Design methods

- Choosing the right techniques can end up being **trial and error**. Some will give you good insights, others might not.
- Use multiple complementary methods to gain both a broad and deep understanding from multiple angles
