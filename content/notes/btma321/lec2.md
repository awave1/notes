A competitve strategy is a statement that identifies a business approach to compete, its goals, and the plans and policies that will be required to carry out the goals - Michael Porter's definition of strategy.

### Alignment

Business leads the IT Strategy/Technology infrastructure. Business has to come up with the requirements and it is up to IT to supply the requirements. **Business demands, IT supplies**. If IT leads, the income, performance, etc, is lacking. Being knee-deep in the tech-stack can lead to ignoring business requirements.

Businesses start bringing CIO (business influence) into companies to support the business part of the company. If business leads the strategy, can only implement Porter's definition of the strategy.

#### Application

|       Competitive Force       |                                                                                     IT Influence on Competitive Force                                                                                      |
| :---------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    Threat of new Entrants     |                                               Can be lowered if there are barriers to entry such as the **scale** of technology investment required to enter                                               |
|  Bargaining Power of Buyers   |                         Can be high if it's easy to switch. **Switching costs** are increased by giving buyers things they value in exchange such as lower costs, effort, or time                          |
| Bargaining Power of Suppliers | Strongest when there are few firms to choose from, quality of inputs is crucial, the volume of purchases is insignificant to the supplier, or the supplier has a strong **brand** and reputationof quality |
| Threat of Substitute Products |                                                Depends on **costs**, including switching costs buyers' face, as well as buyers' willingness to substitutes                                                 |
|     Indusrty Competitors      |                               Rivalry is high when it is expensive to leave an industry, the industry's growth rate is declining , or products have lost of differentiation                                |
