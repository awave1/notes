## Data Types & Permissible Operations

- **Nominal** (categorical)

  - Operations: mode (most common feature value), equality comparison

- **Ordinal**

  - Feature values have an intrinsic order to them, but the difference is not defined
  - Operations: same as nominal, feature value rank

- **Interval**

  - Operations: addition and subtraction are allowed, division and multiplication isn't
  - e.g. dates

- **Ratio**
  - Operations: division and multiplication are allowed

## Data Quality

When making data ready for data mining algorithms, data quality need to be assured

- **Noise**: the destruction of data, something that doesn't make sense in the data
- **Outliers**: Outliers are data points that are considerably different from other data points in the dataset
- **Duplicate data**
- **Missing values**
