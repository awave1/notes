Only after all evaluations have been completed, the evaluators allowed to communicate and have their findings aggregated.

User control and freedom</h3>\n<p>Users often choose system function by mistake and will need a clearly marked \"exit\" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.</p>\n<h3>4. Consistency and standards</h3>\n<p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.</p>\n<h3>5. Error prevention</h3>\n<p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occuring in the first place.</p>\n<h3>6. Recognition rather than recall</h3>\n<p>Minimize the user's memoryload by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.</p>\n<h3>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>\n<p>Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p>\n<h3>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>\n<!--todo: finish-->\n<h3>9.
