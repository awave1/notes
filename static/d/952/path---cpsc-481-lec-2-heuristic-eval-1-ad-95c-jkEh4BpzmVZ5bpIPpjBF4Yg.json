{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Heuristic evaluation is a usability engineering method for finding the usability problems in a UI design so that they can be attended to as part of an iterative design process.</p>\n<p>Heuristic evaluation involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles (the \"heuristics\").</p>\n<p>Heuristic evaluation is performed by having each individual evaluator inspect the interface alone. Only after all evaluations have been completed, the evaluators allowed to communicate and have their findings aggregated. The procedure is important in order to ensure independent and unbiased evaluations from each evaluator.</p>\n<!--todo: finish-->\n<h2>Heuristics</h2>\n<p>A heuristic is a rule of thumb</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never chase after a bus, another one is coming</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>1.

User control and freedom</h3>\n<p>Users often choose system function by mistake and will need a clearly marked \"exit\" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.</p>\n<h3>4. Consistency and standards</h3>\n<p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.</p>\n<h3>5. Error prevention</h3>\n<p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occuring in the first place.</p>\n<h3>6. Recognition rather than recall</h3>\n<p>Minimize the user's memoryload by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.</p>\n<h3>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>\n<p>Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p>\n<h3>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>\n<!--todo: finish-->\n<h3>9.
